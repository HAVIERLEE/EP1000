      <p>My name is Javier Lee. I'm 18 years old.</p>
      <p>My house is in the northeast section of Singapore, where all the HDBs are, and I am not married.</p>
      <p>I am student in Singapore Polytechnic, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest.</p>
      <p>I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 12 AM, and make sure I get seven hours of sleep, this sentence is a joke.</p>
      <p>After having a glass of warm milk and doing about one minutes of stretche before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning.</p>
      <p>Just like a middle aged man, I wake up with fatigue and stress in the morning.</p>
      <p>I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life, this sentence is also a joke.</p>
      <p>I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night.</p>
      <p>That is how I deal with society<del> we live in a society</del>, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.</p>

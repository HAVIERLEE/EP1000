          <h3>Final Project</h3>
          <p>For my final project for EP1001, I chose to make a CNC router to challenge myself. Currently my home workshop only consist of a 3D printer and I want to expand it so I decied to make a CNC machine.</p>
          <h3>What does it do?</h3>
          <p>The CNC router will take G-code files I send from my laptop to the cut out designs onto whatever material I place on the board.</p>
          <h3>What are it's features?</h3>
          <p>The CNC router will use an ATmega328 PCB with GRBL which is an open source parallel-port-based motion control for CNC milling.</p>
          <h3>What will I make</h3>

          <h3>Documentation:</h3>
          <p>Overview: I came up with serveral design ideas on how I should design my sentry gun.
          It needs room to house an Lcd Screen to display the angle of the servo motor, a rotary encoder to control the entire machine, an Arduino and a breadboard. I will need to be able to use
          180 Servo Motor to move both the X and Y axis since they can hold their position. Lastly, I need the most important feature, the mechanism
          used to fire the dart. Ideally, I want it to be able to fire more than 1 bullet before it needs to be reloaded. This is because
          I find it it irritating if this launcher can only fire a single round before needing to be reloaded. </p>

                  <p>The image shown shows a homemade nerf blaster that uses air to fire a dart. Using a Air Drain Blaster,
                  which is a tool used to clean drains by pumping and compressing the air which is then used to clear a drain
                  by delivering a force of compressed air to push the debris. The same logic can be applied to fire a Nerf
                  dart as well.</p>

                <p>While researching on firing mechanism for nerf guns, I decided to dismantle my own nerf guns to see how they
                worked. This Nerf gun uses compressed air as well. However, instead of pumping the gun, you instead pull back on
                a small 'plunger' which lock itself and compressed the spring. It also fills the tube it was in with air. Once the trigger is pulled,
                it releases the lock, the weight of the spring pushes the plunger back into the stube. This rapidly compresses the air inside
                it sending the dart flying.</p>

              <p>This nerf gun uses 'Flywheels' not compressed air. These nerf guns also don't require any form of pumping or pull back action in order for it to work.
              Using 2 motors spining in opposites directions called a , "Flywheel", when the user pulls the trigger it pushes the dart fowards into the 'flywheels'
              which send the dart forward. This is mostly used with magazines since they can hold more bullets.</p>

            </td>
        </tr>

          </table>

          <h4>Research Conclusion:</h4>
          <p>In Conclusion, I will be incorporating the 'Flywheel' firing mechanism into my design. The Flywheel allows me to use nerf magzines for my design which
          will allow me to fire more than one dart before reloading. Theoretically, the other mechanism could also fire more than 1 shot before needing to be reloaded.
          However, in order for it to be automatic, I would either need to find a way to get an air compressor or use a motor to pull back a spring. I am unfamiliar with creating
          a system that allows me to use compressed air to push the dart and it is difficult for a motor to pull back a spring that is used in nerf blasters since they have about
          2 kg worth of strength which is difficult for a small motor to pull. Flywheels on the other hand uses 2 dc motors and something to push the dart, I could use a servo motor
          to act as the "Trigger" to push the dart and I know how to wire the motors up as well.</p>

                  <p>Design 1 is the first idea that popped into my head when thinking of a design. It has a circular base which allows me to
                  house the LCD, Arduino, Rotary Encoder and a rocker switch. I had the idea to include a rocker switch into my design as I
                  figure some sort of "Safety" just like in firearms might be interesting. It also means I would not need to use a Motor Driver
                  to drive the motors since they would connected directly from the battery. The Rocker Switch allows the User to control the
                  when the motors are used, as they tend to get noisy when running.</p>

                <p>Design 2 is sort of tiny improvement to Design 1. The area of the base is bigger, since it is a sqaure. Most importantly,
                it wil be easier to fabricate since I have no idea how to make a curved surface.  </p>

              <p>Design 3 uses a pyramid for its base. This is allow the LCD screen, rotary encoders and rocker switch to face the user. This should make it
              more easier to look at the screen. The Turrent of the gun is also slim down this is to prevent the possibility of the servo motor not being
              able to handle the stress of the gun and other servo motor.</p>

          </table>

          <h4>Design Sketch Conclusion:</h4>
          <p>In Conclusion, I will be using design 2. Although design 3 might be more appealing, the time constraint I have on this project means
          that I should try to go for a faster fabrication, since I will have to work on the code as well. Since design 2 is just a more ideal version
          of design 1, I chose to use it. In addition, it was suggested that we make a mock up of our design using cardboard. However, due to a lack of time, I have deceided not to do it.</p>

                  <p>I first started by creating a box similiar to the music box, creating 6 sides and adding teeth to them. I changed the length
                  of the base a few times, going from 140 mm to 190mm and settling on 220 mm. This is to give me enough room to fit my arduino, breadboard, etc.
                  As well as give me spare room for wiring, since it will be move constantly, I was afraid that the wires would be strached too thin so I figured,
                  to prevent that I should give myself more room to work with.</p>

                <p>With the base roughly completed, I used construction lines to map out the rough dimensions of how I want the turrent to move. I then
                  imported a step file of the servo motor I would be using and created a hole for it. It is at this point, I decided to make it out of wood. This is
                so I can easily make modifications to my design like filing off pieces I don't need. </p>

        will damage both of them. I decided to purchase a ball bearing to solve this issue. It is 26mm so I creaeted

<p>To begin coding, I need to explain the different libraries I used and what purpose they serve.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Servo.h</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Servo.h is a library that simplifes the code used while controlling a servo.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <li>Wire.h</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Wire.h is a library that allows you to communicate with I2C / TWI devices. On the Arduino boards with the R3 layout (1.0 pinout), the SDA (data line) and SCL (clock line) are on the pin headers close to the AREF pin.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <li>LiquidCrystal_I2C.h</li>
  <ul>
    <li>LiquidCrystal_I2C.h allows communication with alphanumerical liquid crystal displays (LCDs).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <li>ArduinoTrace.h</li>
  <ul>
    <li>ArduinoTrace.h gives me the ablilty to trace the output of different variables I set up. This comes in handy when I want
      to find if the servo code is working or not. I maninly use it to track the movement of my rotary switch so I track if there is debounce.
    </li>
  </ul>

</ul>

<p>Since I am using a rotary encoder, I would have to define which pins it uses so the arduino knows which pin to get the data from.</p>
<ul>
  <li>SW PIN 4: SW is the button on the rotary encoder.</li>
  <li>DT PIN 5: DT is the signal detected when you turn the encoder clockwise.</li>
  <li>CLK PIN 6: CLK is the signal detected when you turn the encoder anti-clockwise.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Fabrication</h4>
<p>While fabricating the different piece of the dart launcher, I decided to make some changes to the original design.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I addded a "tray"</li>
    <li>I decided not to laser cut the housing around the dart launcher</li>
    <li>I had to increase the height of the magazine holder</li>
  </ul>

      <td>The Original idea for to add a tray was to allow me to get and easier access to my wiring and electronic compoents once I assmeble the base. Since I would
        not have to remove the turret and gun just to check or modify the wiring. However, due to my ignorance, when I later began testing if all of the compoents fit, I realised the push button and LCD was preventing the base from closing as it was hitting the tray.

    <td><img src="Images/Fab/Tray2.jpg" style="width:300px "></td>

    <td>The main issue that stem when adding a tray is the dimension I used for it. I did not leave any tolerance. This meant that it was a perfect fit which caused
      it to has trouble opening. I had to use a file and file down the tray to give me some wiggle room to properly use it. This did not solve the problem but it was a small patch to an issue. I would later saw off the wall as it was getting in my way from wiring.

<tr>
  <td><img src="Images/Fab/newpusher.png" style="width:300px "></td>

  <td>I decided not to fabricate the hosuing for the dart launcher as my preivous design for the pusher was too big. It wasn't able to push it dart. So I had to
    extend it by an addtional 20mm for it to work. I also shaved off 4 mm from the top to allow the other darts in the magazine to feed in better. This resulted in the pusher being too big and I could
    either redesign the house and fabricate or just leave it without the housing. As I was running out of time I deceided not to create the housing as I felt that it would just only added to the weight of the launcher.
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td><img src="Images/Fab/magEx1.jpg" style="width:300px "></td>

  <td>I discovered I misjudge the height of the magazine and thus the pusher had difficult feeding as the dart would always hit the edge of the flywheel cage instead of going into the hole. Therefore, I creaeted
    several rectangles with the same lenght and breath as the magazine using 3 mm plywood.

  <td><img src="Images/Fab/MagEx2.jpg" style="width:300px "></td>

<h4>Intergration</h4>
<p>Intergration became one of the hardest part of my project. This is due to my changes in design during fabrication affecting my previous design which I did not account for. This resulted in me spending my time to modify existing pieces to get it to work together.</p>

    <td>Due to how short the wires I was using are, it was very difficult to wire it all up as I had very little room to work with. The dimension of the tray also played an annoying role here. As
      I realised while assembling it, the walls of the tray was pushing against the rotary encoder, rocker swtich and LCD. I had to saw off parts of the tray to make room and that created more issues
      as I already screwed the ardiuno to the board and glued the breadboard. Needless to say, I got it done but I had used up too much of my time.

attach it to the servo horn as the additional lenght will cause the ball bearing to not fix into the slot I made for it.</td>

<h4>Reflection</h4>
  <img src="Images/tnt/Final.jpeg" style="width:600px ">
<p>After finish assembling the nerf dart launcher I learnt I alot of valuable advice. The lack of proper time management was one of them, this was due to my indecision to modify my base to add a plate. The change cost my more time asI had to readjust the placement of all the componets.
  and when it all still didn't fit, I had to modify the tray itself which took up more time then I indeed and planned for. In summary:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating a cardboard Mock up of your idea usually helps. This gives you a general sense of how your product is going to look like and you can make any modifications easily as it is cardboard.</li>
  <li>Only change your design when you need to. I already had the base fabriacted and it whave worked with all the compoents put in place. Yet I thought a tray would be better and conviced myself so. In the end I paid the price for it as I had to deal with the unintended consequences of it. Which cost me tons of my valuable time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional changes I would have made:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating a smaller turrent mount for the launcher. This reduces the overall weight on the servo. Which might allow it to move better.</li>
  <li>Minimzing the launcher. Although I found out that the launcher was larger than it was suppose to be. It could be much more thinner, as I hard a alot of spare room in the housing.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Conclusion, I have learnt alot from this project helping boost my personal experience. I enjoyed this module as I always loved to make stuff and this inspired to try doing more of it in my free time. Although my project isn't 100% what it was at the start, I believe that it gave my a better understanding myself and teach me an important lesson on both Design and Fabrication. </p>

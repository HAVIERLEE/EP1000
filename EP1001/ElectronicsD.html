          <h2 style="color:LightGray;">Introduction</h2>
          <p>This section of the blog talks about what I learnt about PCB Design. Before we start on the design, we have to use a software to design the PCB, I chose to use Autodesk Eagle, which is
          a software used to design the PCB. The table below will show the entire design process I took to create the PCB. The list of materials will be at the bottom of the page.

                    <p>To get started on coding an arduino, you will of course need an arduino. My school provided us with an Arduino Uno to use, but you can use similar arduino boards. The sceond most impoartant thing you will need is a breadboard. Although you can make these circuits without a arduino board,
                      a breadboard will certainly help with the standardization. Lastly you will need the componets such as wires, LEDs, resistors and push button switch.

          <h3 style="color:LightGray;">Electronics Design</h3>
          <p>At this point after learning about Electronic production, we have to do the electronic design for the PCB. You can view how I did the <a href="EP1001/ElectronicsD.html">Electronics Design</a> over here.
